## About

Enables a /todoist [slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) to get your Todo items over to your Inbox.

This was built over a few hours for [Node Knockout 2015](http://www.nodeknockout.com/). Please vote above!

## Howto

You can either host this yourself or use our integration.  We suggest hosting
this yourself because honestly, we're developers and that's what we do. :)

1. Create a slash command integration on Slack
 - Tell slack the command name (/todoist - obvie)
 - The callback command should be at http://<whereever.you.installed.com>/slash
 - Tell slack to use the POST method

 Your integration should look like below.

2. Add the integration

Once configured, you'll be able to get your Todos over to [Todoist](https://todoist.com)

    /todoist Send organizers an email to send me our trophy! And some pie!

Will either:

- Send you back a message with a link to do the magic OAuth dance with Todoist

**OR**

- If you're already registered, adds a Todo in your Inbox over at Todoist

## Supported commands

Here's the commands we completed for Node Knockout.

- /todoist Send Node Knockout Judges pies @errands
- /todoist projects
- /todoist today
- /todoist week
- /todoist 7
- /todoist list <project>
- /todoist unregister

## TODOS

Ironically, we used http://todoist.com to track our todos, but since we can't
make them public, we used our trusty text file editor instead.

Check out our [TODOs](TODO.md)

## Feedback

If you have feedback of any kind (you know, to tell us how awesome we are), we're easily found on the Twitters - [@mckayhdavis](https://twitter.com/mckayhdavis) [@ryankanno](https://twitter.com/ryankanno)

## Why did you write the code this way?

Because Internet. Also, because we're not actually Javascript developers. With
that said, we'd love to take pull requests from all you amazing people out
there.
